## What is Kingdom Hall Attendant?

We know that protecting KHA is essential, especially if you handle sensitive information or user data, it is crucial to guarantee the privacy and integrity of the information, for them, KHA includes security and privacy functions, to protect the information of the members of the congregation. Enjoy Kingdom Hall Attendant without limits on any operating system, choose the best version and edition according to your needs. The project is written in Svelte and uses Electron technology to build a cross-platform desktop application.

## How do I start?

Go to the KHA [wiki](https://github.com/livrasand/Kingdom-Hall-Attendant/wiki) to find information on installation, configuration, adding your congregation data, publishers, synchronization and more.

## üîê Security

Kingdom Hall Attendant implements a strong authentication system to ensure that only authorized users can access KHA. In addition, we use an authorization system to control what actions and resources each user can perform or see based on their role in a congregation, or circuit. We make sure that the communication between the client and the server is encrypted using the HTTPS protocol. Also, we encrypt sensitive data in the database to protect it at rest, we use hashing and salting techniques to store information securely. We keep all KHA libraries, frameworks and components up to date. We subtly validate and carefully filter user input to prevent attacks like SQL injections or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). We use secure session tokens and avoid exposing sensitive information in URLs (URLs not on our Whitelist are rejected). And most importantly, we make sure that our users are well informed about security best practices. We know that education is key to avoiding inadvertent security mistakes. For this reason, we carry out informative cybersecurity events for Kingdom Hall Attendant every six months on our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3j3G73t73Dook57HkAD52Q) channel.
